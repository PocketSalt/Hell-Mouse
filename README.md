# Hell Mouse
Bullet Hell With Mouse

Basically: I want to make a Unity game where it's a bullet hell but with your mouse.
So breaking it down:
- Mouse Controlling character [Done]
- Obstacles that deal damage [Done]
- A spawner that spawns obstacles
- Controlling the spawning so it's set patterns
- Different spawners
- Player attack
