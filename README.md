# Hell Mouse
Bullet Hell With Mouse

Basically: I want to make a Unity game where it's a bullet hell but with your mouse.
So breaking it down:
- Mouse Controlling character [Done]
- Obstacles that deal damage [Done]
- A spawner that spawns obstacles [Done]
- Controlling the spawning so it's set patterns [Done]
- Different spawners [Done]
- Player attack [Done]
- Giving spawners health so they can be shot down by the player [Done]
- Spawning in Spawners with set times so they can go in and out of the level
- Creating a boss that ends the game on death


Once all of this is done I want to
- Create Sprites and Animations
- Create backgrounds
- Create sound effects
- Create music
- Create a story
- Create different character types
- Create a visual novel
- Potentially levels, skills, equipment, although I'm not too sure about this
